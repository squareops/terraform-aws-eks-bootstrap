## Addons Details
Kubernetes addons are additional components that can be installed in a Kubernetes cluster to provide extra features and functionality. They are designed to work seamlessly with the Kubernetes API and can be managed just like any other Kubernetes resource. Some common examples of Kubernetes addons include:

<details>
  <summary> AWS ALB </summary>
Amazon Web Services (AWS) Application Load Balancer (ALB) is a highly available and scalable load balancing service that routes incoming application traffic to multiple Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses. It automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, ensuring that your applications are highly available and scalable.

With AWS ALB, you can handle increased traffic levels, automatically scale your applications, and improve the overall performance of your applications. ALB provides advanced routing capabilities, including content-based routing, host-based routing, and path-based routing, enabling you to route traffic to different target groups based on specific rules.
</details>
<details>
  <summary> Node Termination Handler </summary>
In AWS, the Node termination handler can be used in Lambda functions or EC2 instances to handle the termination of the underlying instance or container. When an instance or container is terminated, the termination handler can be used to perform any necessary cleanup operations, such as closing open resources, before the instance or container is terminated.
In an EC2 instance, the termination handler can be set by writing a script that runs on instance startup and sets the process.on('SIGTERM', callback) method. This script can be executed using a user data script or by adding it to the instance's startup script.
</details>
<details>
  <summary> EBS </summary>
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) storage classes are different levels of performance and cost for Amazon EBS volumes. The storage classes determine the type of storage, performance characteristics, and cost of each Amazon EBS volume.

There are currently four Amazon EBS storage classes:

    Standard storage class: This is the default and most widely used storage class, offering a balance of low cost and high performance. It's suitable for a wide range of applications, including boot volumes, transactional databases, and big data workloads.

    Provisioned IOPS (input/output operations per second) storage class: This class provides high-performance I/O for mission-critical and I/O-intensive workloads, such as large databases and I/O-bound applications.

    Cold storage class: This class provides low-cost storage for infrequently accessed data, such as backups and archives. Cold storage is designed to deliver low cost and high durability.

    Throughput Optimized HDD (hard disk drive) storage class: This class provides low-cost storage optimized for large, sequential workloads, such as big data and data warehouses.
</details>
<details>
  <summary> Cert Manager </summary>
  Cert Manager is a Kubernetes add-on that automates the management and issuance of TLS certificates from various issuing sources. It helps to eliminate manual steps in the certificate management process, provides cert renewals and integrates with other parts of the system.
</details>
<details>
  <summary> Cluster Autoscalar </summary>
Cluster Autoscaler is a Kubernetes component that automatically adjusts the number of nodes in a cluster based on the demand for resources. This allows you to optimize the cost of running your workloads while ensuring that they have the resources they need to run effectively.
The Cluster Autoscaler works by monitoring the resource usage of your pods and comparing it to the available capacity on the nodes in the cluster. If there are pods that cannot be scheduled because of resource constraints, the Cluster Autoscaler will increase the number of nodes in the cluster until there is enough capacity to schedule the pending pods. Similarly, if there are nodes in the cluster that are underutilized, the Cluster Autoscaler can decrease the number of nodes to optimize resource utilization and reduce costs.
Cluster Autoscaler is supported by many cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. It can be easily integrated into your existing Kubernetes deployment and can be configured to use different scaling policies to meet the needs of your specific workloads.
</details>
<details>
  <summary> EFS </summary>
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) is a fully managed, scalable, and highly available file storage service for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. It provides a simple and scalable file storage solution that can be used by multiple EC2 instances at the same time, making it ideal for use cases such as big data, content management, and media sharing.

Amazon EFS is easy to set up, manage, and scale, and it automatically replicates data across multiple Availability Zones for high durability and availability. The service is also highly performant, with low latency and high throughput, making it suitable for a wide range of workloads.
</details>
<details>
  <summary> External Secrets </summary>
Kubernetes External Secrets is a feature in Kubernetes that allows secrets to be stored and managed outside of the cluster. External secrets are useful in scenarios where sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, should not be stored directly in the cluster, but still needs to be used by applications running in the cluster.
Kubernetes External Secrets can be stored in external systems such as Hashicorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or GCP Secret Manager, and accessed by pods using a Kubernetes Secret object. The Secret object references the external secret and maps it to a Kubernetes Secret, which can then be used by pods in the same way as regular Kubernetes Secrets.
By using External Secrets, organizations can ensure that sensitive information is securely managed and stored outside of the cluster, while still being able to use that information in their applications running in the cluster.
</details>
<details>
  <summary> Istio </summary>
Istio is an open-source service mesh platform that provides a set of tools for managing and securing microservices applications. Istio is designed to work with containerized applications and is built on top of Kubernetes, making it easy to deploy and manage.
Some of the key features of Istio include:
Traffic management: Istio provides the ability to control the flow of traffic between microservices, including load balancing, fault tolerance, and canary releases.
Security: Istio provides built-in security features, such as mutual TLS authentication, for securing communication between microservices.
Observability: Istio provides robust observability features, including distributed tracing, metric collection, and logging, making it easy to monitor and debug microservices applications.
Configurable policies: Istio provides a flexible policy framework for controlling the behavior of microservices, allowing for easy enforcement of security, observability, and traffic management policies.
Istio is widely adopted and has a strong ecosystem of partners and contributors, making it a popular choice for organizations looking to build and manage microservices applications. By using Istio, organizations can improve the reliability and security of their microservices applications and simplify the process of managing and operating them.
</details>
<details>
  <summary> Karpenter </summary>
Karpenter is a flexible, high-performance Kubernetes cluster autoscaler that helps improve application availability and cluster efficiency. Karpenter launches right-sized compute resources, (for example, Amazon EC2 instances), in response to changing application load in under a minute. Through integrating Kubernetes with AWS, Karpenter can provision just-in-time compute resources that precisely meet the requirements of your workload. Karpenter automatically provisions new compute resources based on the specific requirements of cluster workloads. These include compute, storage, acceleration, and scheduling requirements. Amazon EKS supports clusters using Karpenter, although Karpenter works with any conformant Kubernetes cluster.
</details>
<details>
  <summary> Metrics Server </summary>
Metric Server is a Kubernetes add-on that collects resource usage data from the Kubernetes API server and makes it available to other components, such as the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and the Cluster Autoscaler.
The Metric Server collects data on the CPU and memory usage of pods and nodes in a cluster, and provides this data to other components in a format that they can use to make scaling decisions. The HPA, for example, can use the data provided by the Metric Server to automatically scale the number of replicas of a deployment based on the resource usage of the pods. The Cluster Autoscaler can also use this data to determine when to add or remove nodes from a cluster based on the resource utilization of the pods and nodes.
Metric Server provides a simple and effective way to collect resource usage data from a cluster and make it available to other components for scaling and resource optimization. It is an important component for ensuring that your Kubernetes applications run effectively and efficiently in the cloud.
</details>
<details>
  <summary> Nginx Ingress Controller </summary>
Nginx Ingress Controller is a Kubernetes controller that manages external access to services running in a Kubernetes cluster. It provides load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting, among other features.
The Nginx Ingress Controller works by using the Kubernetes API to dynamically configure an Nginx instance running outside of the cluster to route traffic to services within the cluster. This allows you to easily expose your services to external users and manage the routing of incoming traffic.
The Nginx Ingress Controller provides a flexible and powerful way to manage incoming traffic to your Kubernetes applications. It is widely used in production environments and is well-suited for both simple and complex routing scenarios. Additionally, the Nginx Ingress Controller integrates with other Kubernetes components, such as the Kubernetes Ingress resource and cert-manager, to provide a complete solution for managing external access to your services.
